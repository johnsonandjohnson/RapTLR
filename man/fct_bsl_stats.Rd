\usage{
fct_bsl_stats(
  arg_dataset,
  arg_grp,
  arg_trt_inc = NULL,
  arg_var_num,
  arg_var1 = c("mean", "median"),

  arg_cvt_stg = I
)
}
\arguments{
\item{arg_dataset}{A data frame containing the baseline data to analyze.}

\item{arg_grp}{A grouping variable (unquoted) for treatment groups (e.g., ARM, TRT01A).}

\item{arg_trt_inc}{Optional character vector of treatment group names to include in the
detailed summary. If NULL, only the total is reported. Default is NULL.}

\item{arg_var_num}{A numeric variable (unquoted) to calculate statistics for (e.g., AGE, WEIGHT).}

\item{arg_var1}{The central tendency measure to calculate. Options are "mean" or "median".
Default is "mean".}

\item{arg_var2}{The dispersion measure to calculate. Options are "sd" (standard deviation)
or "range" (min, max). Default is "sd".}

\item{arg_unit}{Character string for the unit of measurement (e.g., "years", "kg", "mg/dL").
Default is "" (no unit).}

\item{arg_label}{Character string describing the variable for the output text
(e.g., "age", "weight", "baseline score"). Default is "".}
}
\value{
A character string containing a formatted summary of baseline statistics,
including the specified central tendency and dispersion measures, suitable for
inclusion in clinical study reports.
}
\description{
This function calculates baseline statistics (mean/median with SD/range) for a numeric
variable by treatment group and generates a formatted text summary suitable for clinical
study reports. It can include overall totals and specific treatment groups in the output.
