# TLR Shell Preparation {#tlr-shell}

## What is a TLR Shell?

A TLR shell is a **template Word document** that contains:

- Pre-written narrative sections
- Placeholder keywords for dynamic content
- A marker for where appendices should be inserted
- Proper formatting and styling

Think of it as a "fill-in-the-blanks" document that RapTLR will complete automatically.

## Creating Your Shell Document

### Step 1: Write Your Narrative

Create a Word document with your standard TLR structure:

```
Study XYZ Top-Line Results

1. Executive Summary
   [Your summary text here]

2. Study Population
   TTsubjectTT
   
3. Efficacy Results
   TTsomethingTT
   
4. Safety Results
   TTsomething2TT

5. Appendices
   LISTOFAPPENDICES
```

### Step 2: Add Placeholder Keywords

**CRITICAL RULES for placeholders:**

1. **Each keyword must be on its own line**
   - Correct: Keyword on separate line
   - Wrong: Inline with other text

2. **Use distinctive, searchable keywords**
   - Good examples: `TTsubjectTT`, `EFFICACY_RATE`, `N_SAFETY_POP`
   - Avoid common words that might appear elsewhere

3. **Document your keywords**
   - Keep a list of what each placeholder represents
   - Use consistent naming conventions

### Step 3: Add Appendix Marker

Insert a keyword where you want TLFs to appear:

```
## Appendices

LISTOFAPPENDICES
```

This keyword will be replaced with a formatted list of all your TLFs with hyperlinks.

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

Use prefixes to organize placeholders:

- `TT...TT` - For text replacements
- `N_...` - For counts
- `PCT_...` - For percentages
- `RESULT_...` - For analysis results

### Version Control

- Keep your shell document in version control
- Use meaningful filenames: `TLR_shell_v1.0.docx`
- Document changes to placeholder keywords

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Inline placeholders** - Always put keywords on separate lines
2. **Duplicate keywords** - Each placeholder should be unique
3. **Missing appendix marker** - Don't forget LISTOFAPPENDICES

Your shell is now ready for RapTLR processing!
